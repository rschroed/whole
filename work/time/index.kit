			<h2>Paid Digital Content for Time Inc.</h2>
			<div class="role">—  Team Leader  •  Design Strategy  •  Account Management  —</div>
			<p>I’ve had the opportunity to work with Time Inc. on many projects over the last couple of years, including a premium celebrity recipe app, several of PEOPLE’s web products, including the people.com home page and many marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>In 2015, I led the team that designed the paywall experience for PEOPLE. Following that project they asked us create a paid content experience for many of their titles, including TIME, Money, Cooking Light, Real Simple, & InStyle. We worked with representatives from each brand to find a solution that utilized best practices while staying true to each unique brand.</p>

<p>I lead the design strategy, handled budgeting and estimating, and maintained the client relationship.</p>

<p>We delivered the paywall placements, a stream of on-boarding emails, and a responsive subscription flow as a full fidelity HTML/CSS prototype ready to be incorporated into their systems.</p>
