<h1>Town Hall Turns Ten!</h1>

<div id="wrap">
<div id="message">
<p>Dear friends,<br />
March 17, 2009 marked the ten year anniversary of the first public performance at Town Hall. Our founders imagined a venue for arts, ideas, advocacy and culture that would be open and democratic; bustling and energetic; dignified, but unstuffy&mdash;a kind of living room for a curious, creative city. A decade and a few thousand events later, we still aspire to uphold this promise. What's the best way to project the next ten years? Spend some time on our anniversary page for a sense of the energy and vitality that has brought Town Hall from a slip of an idea to rich, vivid life&mdash;all in ten short years.
</p>
<p>
Wier Harman<br />
Executive Director
